# Interactive Weather App

## Description

This is an interactive weather application built using React. It provides users with real-time weather information for any location worldwide. Users can search for a specific location and view detailed weather forecasts, including current conditions, hourly forecasts, and a 7-day outlook.

## Features

- **Search**: Users can search for weather information by entering a city name or zip code.
- **Current Weather**: Displays current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
- **Hourly Forecast**: Provides an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours, including temperature and weather conditions.
- **7-Day Outlook**: Shows a 7-day weather forecast, including high and low temperatures, and weather icons.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch weather data.
- CSS: Styling the components.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Happy-huh/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd weather-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

5. Start the development server.

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
